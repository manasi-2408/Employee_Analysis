# Employee Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee performance, compensation alignment, and retention trends to identify inefficiencies and improvement opportunities within an organization. The analysis focuses on performance variation across departments, regions, salary bands, and hiring years, and evaluates whether compensation reflects employee contribution.

The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for business and executive decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze employee performance across departments and regions  
- Evaluate the relationship between salary and performance  
- Identify hiring years with low retention or weak performance outcomes  
- Examine employee attrition trends over time  
- Detect high-salary, low-performance risk areas  

## Key Insights
- Employee performance varies significantly across departments  
- Remote work does not negatively impact performance  
- Hiring quality is inconsistent across different years  
- Compensation is not fully aligned with performance outcomes  
- A significant portion of top-paid employees are low performers  
- Attrition patterns vary by year and region  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Power BI (DAX measures, interactive dashboards)  
- Data Analysis Techniques: aggregation, rate analysis, cohort analysis  

## Dashboard Structure
The Power BI dashboard consists of four main pages:

### Executive Overview
High-level KPIs and workforce metrics

### Performance Analysis
Performance comparison by department, region, and salary band

### Hiring and Retention
Hiring outcomes and employee attrition trends over time

### Compensation Effectiveness
Salary versus performance alignment and compensation risk analysis

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preparation using Python  
2. Exploratory data analysis and metric creation  
3. Business insight generation  
4. Power BI dashboard development  
5. Executive summary and recommendations  

## Business Value
This analysis supports data-driven workforce decisions related to compensation strategy, hiring effectiveness, performance management, and retention planning. It highlights areas where targeted interventions can improve productivity and optimize payroll spending.
